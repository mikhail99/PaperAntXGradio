# PaperAntGradio: Advanced Features Implementation Plan (Methodology-Focused)


#### **1.3 Competitive Intelligence Module** (Weeks 3-4)
*   **Implementation Approach**: The module will query multiple external APIs (patents, academic papers, company funding) and use an LLM to synthesize the findings into a coherent competitive landscape report, focusing on identifying unique differentiation.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Patents**: Google Patents API or USPTO bulk data.
    *   **Academic**: arXiv and Semantic Scholar APIs.
    *   **Company Info**: Crunchbase or PitchBook APIs for funding and company data.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `requests`: For interacting with various REST APIs.
    *   `semantic-scholar-py`, `arxiv`: For fetching academic papers.
    *   `NetworkX`: To visualize the competitive landscape and show differentiation.


## ðŸ“Š **Feature 2: Industry-Focused Literature Analysis**

### **Objective**
Enhance literature review capabilities with industry-specific intelligence, prioritizing papers by business relevance and tracking competitive research activities.

### **Core Components & Implementation Strategy**

#### **2.1 Industry Relevance Scorer** (Weeks 5-6)
*   **Implementation Approach**: A semantic search system. We will generate vector embeddings for all reviewed papers and for descriptions of our target industry domains. The relevance score will be calculated based on the cosine similarity between paper and domain embeddings.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Embeddings**: Pre-trained scientific language models like `SciBERT` or `SPECTER` will be used to generate high-quality paper embeddings.
    *   **Labeled Data**: A small, manually curated dataset of papers labeled with industry relevance will be needed to validate the model's accuracy.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `sentence-transformers`: To generate document embeddings.
    *   `ChromaDB`/`Faiss`: For efficient similarity search in the vector space.
    *   `dspy-ai`: To provide a natural language justification for why a paper is deemed relevant.

#### **2.2 Patent Landscape Analyzer** (Week 6)
*   **Implementation Approach**: Real-time API calls to patent databases. The module will extract keywords from the proposal and use them to query patent databases, summarizing potential overlaps.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Primary**: Google Patents API for real-time search.
    *   **Secondary**: USPTO Bulk Data can be used for offline, large-scale analysis.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `requests`: To query the Google Patents API.
    *   `NetworkX`: To visualize patent citation networks and identify key inventors or companies.
    *   `google-cloud-bigquery`: Potentially, to query the public Google Patents dataset for deeper analysis.

#### **2.3 Competitor Research Tracker** (Week 7)
*   **Implementation Approach**: An automated agent that monitors specific data sources for new research from competitor companies. It will track author affiliations on academic sites and monitor company engineering blogs.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   Academic APIs (arXiv, Semantic Scholar) filtered by company affiliations.
    *   RSS feeds from major competitors' engineering and research blogs.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `feedparser`: To subscribe to and parse RSS feeds.
    *   `arxiv`, `semantic-scholar-py`: To filter papers by author affiliation.
    *   `ChromaDB`: To store and search competitor intelligence data over time.


## ðŸ“ˆ **Feature 3: Industry Trend Prediction Engine**

### **Objective**
Build a predictive system that analyzes multiple data sources to forecast which ML/CV research directions will become commercially viable and when.

### **Core Components & Implementation Strategy**

#### **3.1 Multi-Source Data Collector** (Week 8)
*   **Implementation Approach**: A set of scheduled, asynchronous data collectors that pull data from various APIs and store it in a time-series database or a structured format (e.g., Parquet files).
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Code**: GitHub API (tracking repo stars, forks, issues).
    *   **Jobs**: Scraping LinkedIn Jobs or Indeed, or using a paid API like Adzuna.
    *   **Funding**: Crunchbase or PitchBook APIs for VC investment data.
    *   **Academic**: Conference websites (NeurIPS, CVPR) and arXiv for paper submission trends.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `PyGithub`: To interact with the GitHub API.
    *   `py-crunchbase`: For funding data.
    *   `APScheduler`/`Celery`: To schedule and run background data collection tasks.

#### **3.2 Trend Analysis Engine** (Weeks 9-10)
*   **Implementation Approach**: A time-series forecasting model. We will analyze the collected data to identify leading indicators of a trend's growth. A model (like Meta's `Prophet` or a custom LSTM) will be trained to predict the future trajectory of these indicators.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**: The time-series data collected by the collectors in step 3.1.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `pandas`/`numpy`: For time-series data manipulation.
    *   `prophet` (by Meta) or `statsmodels`: For time-series forecasting.
    *   `scikit-learn`: For feature engineering and building predictive models.

#### **3.3 Trend Visualization Dashboard & Alert System** (Week 10-11)
*   **Implementation Approach**: An interactive dashboard built within the Gradio UI that allows users to explore trend data. An alert system will run in the background, detecting trend inflection points and sending notifications.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `Plotly`/`Altair`: For creating interactive charts within the Gradio application.
    *   `APScheduler`: To run the weekly report generation and alerting logic.
    *   `slack_sdk` or `smtplib`: To send alerts to users via Slack or email.
