---

## üèóÔ∏è **Feature 1: Business-Technical Bridge Assistant**

### **Objective**
Create an AI system that automatically translates technical ML/CV research proposals into business impact assessments, addressing the core pain point of aligning technical innovation with business value.

### **Core Components & Implementation Strategy**

#### **1.1 Technical Feasibility Analyzer** (Weeks 1-2)
*   **Implementation Approach**: A hybrid AI model. An LLM, guided by a `dspy.Signature`, will perform a qualitative analysis of the proposal to identify risk factors. This structured text output will be combined with quantitative features (e.g., estimated complexity, data requirements) and fed into a classical ML model (e.g., Gradient Boosting) to produce a final feasibility score.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Primary**: Internal historical project data is critical. We need a dataset of ~30-50 past proposals, annotated with their resource requirements, timelines, and final outcomes (e.g., success, partial success, failure, budget overrun).
    *   **Secondary**: Public project datasets (e.g., from GitHub) can be used to pre-train models or augment internal data if it's sparse.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `dspy-ai`: To create the `TechnicalFeasibilitySignature` for structured LLM analysis.
    *   `scikit-learn`: To train the numerical prediction model for the feasibility score.
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation and feature engineering on historical project data.

#### **1.2 Business Impact Calculator** (Weeks 2-3)
*   **Implementation Approach**: We will use a combination of LLM-driven analysis and structured financial modeling. The LLM will extract key concepts from the proposal and use external data sources to estimate market size and identify customer pain points. These parameters will then be used in a programmatic ROI model.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Market Data**: APIs from market research firms (e.g., Gartner, Statista) or web-scraped data from industry reports.
    *   **Financial Data**: Internal data on past project costs, product revenue, and customer lifetime value (LTV).
    *   **Qualitative Data**: Web-scraped data from industry news, competitor websites, and product review sites to gauge customer needs.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `dspy-ai`: For qualitative analysis (e.g., "Summarize the key value proposition for the customer").
    *   `BeautifulSoup`/`Scrapy`: For web scraping market and customer data.
    *   `numpy`/`pandas`: For implementing the financial ROI and TCO models.

#### **1.3 Competitive Intelligence Module** (Weeks 3-4)
*   **Implementation Approach**: The module will query multiple external APIs (patents, academic papers, company funding) and use an LLM to synthesize the findings into a coherent competitive landscape report, focusing on identifying unique differentiation.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Patents**: Google Patents API or USPTO bulk data.
    *   **Academic**: arXiv and Semantic Scholar APIs.
    *   **Company Info**: Crunchbase or PitchBook APIs for funding and company data.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `requests`: For interacting with various REST APIs.
    *   `semantic-scholar-py`, `arxiv`: For fetching academic papers.
    *   `NetworkX`: To visualize the competitive landscape and show differentiation.

#### **1.4 Resource Planning Engine** (Week 4)
*   **Implementation Approach**: An LLM-based estimation model fine-tuned on internal project management data. It will analyze the proposal's technical requirements and predict team composition, roles, and infrastructure needs.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   **Internal PM Data**: Exported data from tools like Jira or Asana, showing task types, effort (story points/hours), and assigned roles.
    *   **Cloud Pricing**: Public pricing data from AWS, GCP, and Azure.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
    *   `dspy-ai`: To structure the output from the LLM-based estimation.
    *   `pandas`: To analyze and create features from historical project data.

    *   `NetworkX`: To visualize patent citation networks and identify key inventors or companies.
    *   `google-cloud-bigquery`: Potentially, to query the public Google Patents dataset for deeper analysis.

#### **2.3 Competitor Research Tracker** (Week 7)
*   **Implementation Approach**: An automated agent that monitors specific data sources for new research from competitor companies. It will track author affiliations on academic sites and monitor company engineering blogs.
*   **Datasets & Data Sources**:
    *   Academic APIs (arXiv, Semantic Scholar) filtered by company affiliations.
    *   RSS feeds from major competitors' engineering and research blogs.
*   **Key Libraries & Tools**:
