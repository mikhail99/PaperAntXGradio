## Abstract
This literature review examines the current state of Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings, analyzing their applications, benefits, and challenges.

## Key Findings
- **Personalized Learning**: LLMs enable adaptive learning experiences tailored to individual student needs
- **Assessment Automation**: Automated grading and feedback systems show promising results
- **Content Generation**: Teachers can leverage LLMs for creating educational materials

## Research Gaps
1. Long-term impact on student learning outcomes
2. Ethical considerations in AI-assisted education
3. Teacher training requirements for LLM integration

## Recommendations
- Implement pilot programs to test LLM effectiveness
- Develop ethical guidelines for educational AI use
- Create comprehensive teacher training programs
