# Research Methodology: LLM Educational Impact Study

## Research Design
**Mixed-methods approach** combining quantitative assessment data with qualitative interviews

## Participants
- **Students**: 200 undergraduate students across 4 universities
- **Teachers**: 30 educators with varying levels of AI experience
- **Duration**: 12-month longitudinal study

## Data Collection Methods

### Quantitative Measures
1. **Pre/Post Learning Assessments**: Standardized tests measuring subject knowledge
2. **Engagement Metrics**: Time-on-task, completion rates, interaction frequency
3. **Performance Analytics**: Grade improvements, assignment quality scores

### Qualitative Methods
1. **Student Interviews**: Semi-structured interviews about learning experience
2. **Teacher Focus Groups**: Discussions on LLM integration challenges and benefits
3. **Classroom Observations**: Ethnographic study of LLM-enhanced lessons

## Data Analysis Plan
- **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA for pre/post comparisons, regression analysis for predictors
- **Thematic Analysis**: Coding of interview transcripts using grounded theory approach
- **Mixed-Methods Integration**: Convergent parallel design for data triangulation

## Ethical Considerations
- IRB approval obtained from all participating institutions
- Informed consent from all participants
- Data anonymization and secure storage protocols
