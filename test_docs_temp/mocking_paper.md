# The Art of Mocking

Mocking is a technique in software testing where a substitute object is used
in place of a real object. This is often done to isolate the code under test
from its dependencies. This allows for more focused and faster tests.

There are two main types of mocks: stubs and mocks. Stubs provide canned
responses to calls made during the test, while mocks are objects that can
verify that certain calls were made on them.
