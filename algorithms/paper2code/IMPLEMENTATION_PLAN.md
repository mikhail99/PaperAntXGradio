# Paper2ImplementationDoc: Iterative Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of the modular pipeline described in IMPLEMENTATION_SKETCH.md. Each iteration focuses on a subset of the pipeline, with validation steps at the end. Use this as a living checklist.

The plan follows a **two-stage architecture**: Extended Planning (Stages 1-3) and Guided Summarization (Stages 4-6).

## Iteration 3: Abstraction Planning ✅ COMPLETED

-[x] Implement `utils/abstraction_detector.py` for hybrid rule-based + LLM abstraction detection
-[x] Create `abstraction_planning_nodes.py` with nodes for:

    -[x] `SaveAbstractionsNode`: Save abstraction plan with metadata
-[x] Create `abstraction_planning_flow.py` to orchestrate abstraction planning
-[x] **Validation:**
    -[x] Check that abstractions are correctly identified and categorized
    -[x] Save abstraction plan to `output/abstraction_plan.json`
    -[x] Verify parameterizable abstraction types work correctly

**Results:** Successfully implemented hybrid rule-based + LLM abstraction detection with 6 parameterizable abstraction types. Identified 15 abstractions across 4 sections with advanced categorization including importance scoring, relationship mapping, and complexity assessment. Generated comprehensive `abstraction_plan.json` (25KB) with structured categorization data. All 10 validation tests passed.

## **Key Iteration Benefits**

- **Explicit Planning First:** Iterations 2-4 establish comprehensive planning before any summarization
- **Guided Summarization:** Iterations 5-6 leverage planning artifacts for focused, accurate analysis
- **Clear Separation:** Planning logic completely separated from summarization logic
- **Traceability:** Each iteration builds on previous artifacts with clear lineage
- **Modularity:** Each stage can be debugged, optimized, or replaced independently
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new abstraction types or planning dimensions
