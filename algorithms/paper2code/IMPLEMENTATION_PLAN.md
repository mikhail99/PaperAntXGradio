# Paper2ImplementationDoc: Iterative Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of the modular pipeline described in IMPLEMENTATION_SKETCH.md. Each iteration focuses on a subset of the pipeline, with validation steps at the end. Use this as a living checklist.

---

## Iteration 1: Core PDF Processing ✅ COMPLETED

-[x] Create `0_pdf_process_nodes.py` with nodes for PDF validation and text extraction
-[x] Implement `utils/pdf_processor.py` for PDF loading and text extraction (PyMuPDF)
-[x] Create `0_pdf_process_flow.py` to orchestrate PDF processing nodes
-[x] Add minimal test PDF(s) to `paper2code/`
-[x] **Validation:**
    -[x] Run flow on test PDF, verify raw text and metadata extraction
    -[x] Save intermediate output to `output/`

---

## Iteration 2: Section Splitting & Planning ✅ COMPLETED

-[x] Implement `utils/section_detector.py` for regex-based section splitting
-[x] Create `1_planning_nodes.py` for section splitting and LLM-based section selection
-[x] Implement `utils/llm_interface.py` (using ollama)
-[x] Create `1_planning_flow.py` to connect planning nodes
-[x] **Validation:**
    -[x] Run on extracted text, verify correct section splits and LLM section selection
    -[x] Save selected sections to `output/`

**Results:** Successfully detected 6 sections and selected 4 relevant sections (Abstract, Methodology, Introduction, Implementation) using heuristic fallback. Generated `planning_results.json` with comprehensive section analysis.

## Iteration 3: Section Summarization & Component Analysis

-[ ] Implement `utils/component_analyzer.py` for rule-based extraction (algorithms, methods, etc.)
-[ ] Create `2_summarization_nodes.py` for LLM-based summarization and component extraction
-[ ] Create `2_summarization_flow.py` to orchestrate summarization/analysis
-[ ] **Validation:**
    -[ ] Check that algorithms, workflows, and data requirements are extracted and summarized
    -[ ] Save summaries and extracted components to `output/`

---

## Iteration 4: Review & QA

-[ ] Create `3_review_nodes.py` for review, validation, and QA (LLM or rule-based)
-[ ] Create `3_review_flow.py` to connect review nodes
-[ ] Add user query/feedback node (optional)
-[ ] **Validation:**
    -[ ] Validate summaries/components for correctness and completeness
    -[ ] Save review/QA results to `output/`

---

## Iteration 5: Documentation Generation

-[ ] Create `4_docgen_nodes.py` for combining outputs into Markdown/diagrams
-[ ] Create `4_docgen_flow.py` to orchestrate doc generation
-[ ] Implement output saving to `output/` directory
-[ ] **Validation:**
    -[ ] Generate final implementation guide, check formatting and completeness
    -[ ] Review with sample papers

---

## Iteration 6: Refactoring, Testing, and Extensions

-[ ] Refactor utility modules for clarity and reusability
-[ ] Add unit/integration tests in `test/`
-[ ] Add support for arXiv download (`utils/arxiv_api.py`)
-[ ] Add advanced utilities (embedding search, HTML/LaTeX support)
-[ ] Update `README.md` and `requirements.txt`
-[ ] **Validation:**
    -[ ] All tests pass, pipeline runs end-to-end on multiple papers
    -[ ] Documentation is up to date

---

## Ongoing/Optional

-[ ] Save all intermediate artifacts for traceability
-[ ] Add more test papers and edge cases
-[ ] Optimize for speed and robustness
-[ ] Add user interface or Gradio demo (future)
