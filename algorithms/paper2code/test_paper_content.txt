A Novel Approach to Machine Learning Optimization

Abstract

This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm for machine learning models.
Our approach combines gradient descent with adaptive learning rates to achieve
faster convergence and better performance.

1. Introduction

Machine learning optimization is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence.
In this work, we propose AdaptiveGrad, a novel optimization algorithm.

2. Methodology  

Our proposed AdaptiveGrad algorithm consists of three main components:
1. Gradient History Tracking
2. Curvature Estimation  
3. Adaptive Rate Adjustment

3. Results

We evaluated AdaptiveGrad on benchmark datasets and show improvements.

4. Conclusion

We have presented AdaptiveGrad, a novel optimization algorithm.
