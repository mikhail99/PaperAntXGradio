## Technical Architecture

### Connection Detection Methods

1. **Rule-Based Detection**:
   - Dependency patterns: `requires`, `depends on`, `needs`, `built on`, `based on`
   - Workflow patterns: `step X...step Y`, `first...then`, `follows`, `after`, `feeds into`
   - Composition patterns: `contains`, `includes`, `consists of`, `part of`
   - Confidence: 0.7 (consistent baseline)

2. **Mock LLM Detection**:
   - Algorithm-method dependencies (confidence: 0.8)
   - Architecture-component compositions (confidence: 0.7)
   - Workflow sequences based on names (confidence: 0.6)
   - Neural network dependencies (confidence: 0.8)
   - Implementation relationships (confidence: 0.7)

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combines rule-based and LLM results
   - Deduplicates based on source-target-type pairs
   - Boosts confidence for hybrid detections (+0.1, max 1.0)
   - Preserves best confidence for duplicates

### Connection Types Supported

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **dependency** | A requires B | Algorithm needs method, neural network requires attention |
| **workflow** | A feeds into B | Step 1 → Step 2, preprocessing → analysis |
| **composition** | A is part of B | Architecture contains components, framework includes modules |
| **alternative** | A or B (mutually exclusive) | Different approaches, alternative methods |
| **semantic** | A relates to B conceptually | Related concepts, similar abstractions |
| **implementation** | A implements B | Code implements algorithm, library provides framework |

### Data Structures

- **Connection**: source_id, target_id, connection_type, confidence, description, evidence, detection_method, bidirectional
- **DependencyChain**: chain_id, abstractions (ordered list), chain_type (linear/circular), description
- **Connection Matrix**: source_id → [target_id:connection_type] for visualization

## Next Steps: Guided Summarization

**Iteration 4 completes the Extended Planning phase**. The comprehensive planning artifacts (sections, abstractions, connections) now enable **Stage II: Guided Summarization**:

1. **Section-wise Analysis**: Use section planning to structure content systematically
2. **Abstraction-focused Content**: Leverage categorized abstractions for targeted analysis
3. **Connection-aware Navigation**: Use relationship mappings for intelligent content linking
4. **Workflow-guided Documentation**: Follow dependency chains for logical flow organization

**Iteration 4 successfully completed Connection Planning** with:
- ✅ **30 connections detected** across 15 abstractions
- ✅ **4 dependency chains identified** for workflow understanding
- ✅ **Hybrid detection approach** combining rule-based and LLM analysis
- ✅ **100% test success rate** across 14 comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Complete integration** with previous iteration results
- ✅ **Structured output format** ready for guided summarization

The **Extended Planning phase is now complete**, providing explicit, well-documented planning that enables comprehensive guided summarization in subsequent iterations. The two-stage architecture design has proven effective, with clear separation of concerns between upfront planning and guided content generation.
