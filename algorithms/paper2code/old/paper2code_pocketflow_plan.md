# Paper2ImplementationDoc Plan (PocketFlow Approach)

This plan outlines how to implement a tool that generates implementation documentation from academic papers using the modular, agentic workflow style of PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge. The goal is to help developers understand how to implement papers through clear logical design documentation, not extract actual code.

---

## Iteration 1: Project Setup & Core Pipeline
- [ ] Set up a new Python project structure (using the PocketFlow template as a base)
- [ ] Define the core pipeline in `main.py` and `flow.py`
- [ ] Implement basic node structure in `nodes.py` (PDF input, text extraction, analysis, doc generation)
- [ ] Add configuration and requirements files
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Run the pipeline on a sample PDF and verify that each node is called in sequence
    - [ ] Ensure logs and errors are clear

---

## Iteration 2: PDF Parsing & Text Extraction Node
- [ ] Implement a node for PDF parsing (using PyMuPDF or similar)
- [ ] Output: structured text with section headers, abstracts, methodology sections
- [ ] Add section detection (Introduction, Methods, Results, etc.)
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Parse several academic PDFs and verify text extraction quality
    - [ ] Check that sections are properly identified and separated

---

## Iteration 3: Paper Structure Analysis Node
- [ ] Implement a node to analyze paper structure and identify key components:
    - [ ] Algorithm descriptions
    - [ ] Mathematical formulations
    - [ ] Methodology steps
    - [ ] System architecture descriptions
- [ ] Output: structured data about paper components
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Analyze various paper types and verify component identification accuracy
    - [ ] Review false positives/negatives in methodology detection

---

## Iteration 4: Implementation Logic Extraction Node
- [ ] Implement a node to extract implementation-relevant information:
    - [ ] Data structures mentioned
    - [ ] Algorithm steps and pseudocode
    - [ ] Input/output specifications
    - [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Output: logical design elements
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Extract logic from well-known papers and compare with known implementations
    - [ ] Ensure captured information is sufficient for understanding implementation

---

## Iteration 5: LLM-Powered Analysis Node
- [ ] Integrate LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) for intelligent analysis:
    - [ ] Summarize methodology in implementation terms
    - [ ] Identify key algorithms and data flows
    - [ ] Generate high-level architecture descriptions
    - [ ] Suggest implementation approaches
- [ ] Output: AI-enhanced implementation guidance
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Compare LLM analysis with human expert analysis
    - [ ] Test on papers with known implementations for accuracy

---

## Iteration 6: Documentation Generation Node
- [ ] Implement a node to generate structured implementation documentation:
    - [ ] High-level system architecture
    - [ ] Algorithm flowcharts/pseudocode
    - [ ] Data structure specifications
    - [ ] Implementation checklist
    - [ ] Key considerations and challenges
- [ ] Output: Markdown documentation files
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Review generated docs for clarity and completeness
    - [ ] Test with developers to see if docs help implementation understanding

---

## Iteration 7: Multi-Format Output Node
- [ ] Support multiple output formats:
    - [ ] Markdown documentation
    - [ ] Mermaid diagrams for architecture/flow
    - [ ] JSON schema for data structures
    - [ ] Implementation roadmap/timeline
- [ ] Add customizable templates
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Generate docs in all formats and verify quality
    - [ ] Test templates with different paper types

---

## Iteration 8: CLI & User Interface
- [ ] Implement a CLI following PocketFlow's style:
    - [ ] Input options (PDF file, URL, arXiv ID)
    - [ ] Output format selection
    - [ ] Analysis depth configuration
- [ ] Add progress indicators and verbose logging
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Test CLI with various options and paper types
    - [ ] Ensure user-friendly error messages and help

---

## Iteration 9: Quality Assessment & Validation Node
- [ ] Add automated quality checks:
    - [ ] Completeness scoring (are key sections covered?)
    - [ ] Clarity assessment (is the documentation clear?)
    - [ ] Implementation feasibility check
- [ ] Generate quality reports alongside documentation
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Compare quality scores with human expert ratings
    - [ ] Refine scoring algorithms based on feedback

---

## Iteration 10: Advanced Features (Optional)
- [ ] Add support for multiple input formats (HTML, LaTeX, arXiv direct)
- [ ] Implement paper comparison mode (compare implementation approaches)
- [ ] Add plugin system for domain-specific analysis
- [ ] Integration with code repositories (suggest similar implementations)
- [ ] **Validation:**
    - [ ] Test new features on diverse academic papers
    - [ ] Gather user feedback and iterate

---

## Final Validation & Release
- [ ] Run full pipeline on papers from different domains (ML, systems, theory, etc.)
- [ ] Test with real developers trying to implement papers
- [ ] Collect feedback on documentation usefulness
- [ ] Polish UX and fix edge cases
- [ ] Create comprehensive user guide and examples
- [ ] Tag and release v1.0
