# Iteration 3 Summary: Abstraction Planning

**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

This iteration successfully implemented the abstraction planning stage of the Paper2ImplementationDoc pipeline, building on the section planning results from Iteration 2.

## üéØ Implementation Overview

Iteration 3 introduced a sophisticated **hybrid rule-based + LLM approach** for identifying, categorizing, and planning abstractions from academic papers. The implementation follows the two-stage architecture defined in the updated implementation plan.

### **Stage 2: Abstraction Planning** 
- **Flow**: `identify_abstractions >> categorize_abstractions >> save_abstractions`
- **Approach**: Hybrid rule-based + LLM detection with parameterizable abstraction types
- **Output**: Structured JSON with categorized abstractions and metadata
