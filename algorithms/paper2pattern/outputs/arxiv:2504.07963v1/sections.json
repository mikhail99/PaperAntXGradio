    "content": "We present PixelFlow, a family of image generation models that operate directly in the raw pixel space, in contrast to the predominant latent-space models. This approach simplifies the image generation process by eliminating the need for a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and enabling the whole model end-to-end trainable. Through efficient cascade flow modeling, PixelFlow achieves affordable computation cost in pixel space. It achieves an FID of 1.98 on 256×\\times×256 ImageNet class-conditional image generation benchmark. The qualitative text-to-image results demonstrate that PixelFlow excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope this new paradigm will inspire and open up new opportunities for next-generation visual generation models. Code and models are available at https://github.com/ShoufaChen/PixelFlow."

    "content": "Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate. — William of Ockham Figure 1: Comparisons of Design Paradigms between latent-based diffusion models (LDMs), pixel-based diffusion models (PDMs), and PixelFlow: (a) LDMs split training into two separate stages—first independently training off-the-shell VAEs, then training diffusion models on tokens extracted from the pre-trained VAEs; (b) Previous PDMs typically train two separate models: a diffusion model on low-resolution images and an upsampler for high-resolution synthesis; (c) PixelFlow, by contrast, offers an end-to-end solution for pixel-based generation, combining both high efficiency and strong generative performance. Driven by the success of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model series [50, 47, 46, 17], latent diffusion models (LDMs) [50] have emerged as the de facto standard for generative modeling across diverse modalities, spanning image [17, 45, 35], video [23, 66, 7, 8, 69], audio [39, 18], and 3D [57, 67]. As shown in Figure 1 (a), LDMs compress raw data into a compact latent space using pre-trained Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). This compression reduces computational demands and facilitates efficient diffusion denoising. Despite their widespread success, LDMs decouple the VAE and diffusion components, hindering joint optimization and complicating holistic diagnosis. An alternative approach is to implement diffusion models in the raw pixel space. While intuitive, this becomes computationally unaffordable for high-resolution images due to the substantial resources required to process per-pixel correlations. Considering this, prior research [52, 20, 22, 51, 44] has typically adopted a cascaded approach: first generating a low-resolution image, then employing additional upsamplers to produce high-quality outputs, with the low-resolution image serving as conditioning input, as shown in Figure 1(b). However, these cascaded methods also introduce separate networks for different stages, still limiting the benefits of end-to-end design. In this work, we introduce PixelFlow, a simple but effective end-to-end framework for direct image generation in raw pixel space, without the need of separate networks like VAEs or upsamplers. As illustrated in Figure 1(c), PixelFlow uses a unified set of parameters to model multi-scale samples across cascading resolutions via Flow Matching [40, 38]. At early denoising stages, when noise levels are high, PixelFlow operates on lower-resolution samples. As denoising progresses, the resolution gradually increases until it reaches the target resolution in the final stage. This progressive strategy avoids performing all denoising steps at full resolution, thereby significantly reducing the overall computational cost of the generation process. During training, the cross-scale samples at different timesteps are constructed by: (1) resizing the images to successive scales and adding Gaussian noise to each scaled image; (2) interpolating between adjacent scale noisy images as model input and conducting velocity prediction. The entire model is trained end-to-end using uniformly sampled training examples from all stages. During inference, the process begins with pure Gaussian noise at the lowest resolution. The model then progressively denoises and upscales the image until the target resolution is reached. We evaluated PixelFlow on both class-conditional and text-to-image generation tasks. Compared to established latent-space diffusion models [50, 45, 42], PixelFlow delivers competitive performance. For instance, on the 256×256256256256\\times 256256 × 256 ImageNet class-conditional generation benchmark, PixelFlow achieves an FID of 1.98. For text-to-image generation, PixelFlow is evaluated on widely-used benchmarks, achieving 0.64 on GenEval [19] and 77.93 on DPG-Bench [26]. In addition, qualitative results in Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate that PixelFlow has strong visual fidelity and text-image alignment, highlighting the potential of pixel-space generation for future research. The contributions of PixelFlow are summarized as in the following three points: • By eliminating the need for a pre-trained VAE, we establish an end-to-end trainable image generation model in raw pixel space directly. • Through cascade flow modeling from low resolution to high resolution, our model achieves affordable computation cost in both training and inference. • PixelFlow obtains competitive performance in visual quality, including 1.98 FID on 256×256256256256\\times 256256 × 256 ImageNet class-conditional image generation benchmark and appealing properties on text-to-image generation."

    "content": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become a core component in many recent generative models [16, 48, 50, 47, 59, 17, 66, 35], enabling the mapping of visual data from pixel space to a lower-dimensional, perceptually equivalent latent space. This compact representation facilitates more efficient training and inference. However, VAEs often compromise high-frequency details [47], leading to inevitable low-level artifacts in generated outputs. Motivated by a desire for algorithmic simplicity and fully end-to-end optimization, we forgo the VAE and operate directly in pixel space."

    "content": "Early diffusion models [56, 21, 2] primarily operated directly in pixel space, aiming to capture the distributions images in a single stage. However, this approach proved both challenging and inefficient for high-resolution image generation, leading to the development of cascaded models [52, 20, 22, 30] that generate images through a sequence of stages. These cascaded models typically begin with the generation of a low-resolution image, which is subsequently upscaled by super-resolution models to achieve higher resolutions. However, the diffusion-based super-resolution process often requires starting from pure noise, conditioned on lower-resolution outputs, resulting in a time-consuming and inefficient generation process. Additionally, training these models in isolated stages hinders end-to-end optimization and necessitates carefully designed strategies to ensure the super-resolution stages. Furthermore, recent advancements in pixel-space generation have introduced innovative architectures. Simple Diffusion [24, 25] proposes a streamlined diffusion framework for high-resolution image synthesis, achieving strong performance on ImageNet through adjustments of model architecture and noise schedules. FractalGen [37] constructs fractal generative models by recursively invoking atomic generative modules, resulting in self-similar architectures that demonstrate strong performance in pixel-by-pixel image generation. TarFlow [68] presents a Transformer-based normalizing flow architecture capable of directly modeling and generating pixels."

    "title": "3.1 Preliminary: Flow Matching",
    "level": 3,
    "content": "The Flow Matching algorithm [1, 38, 40] progressively transforms a sample from a prior distribution, which is typically a standard normal distribution, to the target data distribution. This is accomplished by defining a forward process consisting of a sequence of linear paths that directly connect samples from the prior distribution to corresponding samples in the target distribution. During training, a training example is constructed by first sampling a target sample 𝐱1subscript𝐱1\\mathbf{x}_{1}bold_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, drawing noise 𝐱0∼𝒩⁢(0,1)similar-tosubscript𝐱0𝒩01\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)bold_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∼ caligraphic_N ( 0 , 1 ) from the standard normal distribution, and selecting a timestep t∈[0,1]𝑡01t\\in[0,1]italic_t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ].

A notable advantage of Flow Matching is its ability to interpolate between two arbitrary distributions, not restricted to using only a standard Gaussian as the source domain. Consequently, in image generation tasks, Flow Matching extends beyond noise-to-image scenarios and can be effectively employed for diverse applications such as image-to-image translation. Figure 2: PixelFlow for cascaded image generation from pixel space. We partition the entire generation procedure into series resolution stages. At the beginning of each resolution stage, we upscale the relatively noisy results from the preceding stage and use them as the starting point for the current stage. Consequently, as the resolution enhances, more refined samples can be obtained."

Within each resolution stage, we apply standard flow-based sampling, using either the Euler discrete sampler [17] or the Dopri5 solver, depending on the desired trade-off between speed and accuracy. To ensure smooth and coherent transitions across scales, we adopt an renoising strategy [60, 29], which effectively mitigates the jumping point issue [4] often observed in multi-scale generation pipelines."

However, this approach is inefficient in practice, as tokens at extremely low resolutions convey limited meaningful information. Furthermore, allocating excessive timesteps to very short sequences underutilizes the computational capacity of modern GPUs, resulting in decreased model FLOPS utilizationt. Therefore, we explore how varying the resolution at which image generation begins, which we call kickoff image resolution, impacts overall performance. kickoff seq. len.

All models are trained with 600k iterations on ImageNet-1K. Patch size is 2×\\times×2 and target image resolution is 64×\\times×64. For our transformer-based backbone, the number of tokens involved in attention operations is determined by the raw image resolution and the patch size. In this experiment, we maintain a consistent patch size of 2×\\times×2 [45], making the kickoff sequence length directly dependent on the kickoff image resolution. Specifically, we evaluate three kickoff sequence length—2×\\times×2, 8×\\times×8, and 32×\\times×32—while keeping the target resolution fixed at 64×\\times×64. Notably, the 32×\\times×32 setting represents a vanilla pixel-based approach without cascading across resolutions. As shown in Table 1, among these configurations, the 8×\\times×8 kickoff sequence length achieves comparable or even slightly improved FID compared to the 32×\\times×32 baseline. This suggests that initiating generation from an appropriately smaller resolution and progressively scaling up can maintain generation quality while improving computational efficiency by allocating fewer computations to the largest resolution stage. Conversely, reducing the kickoff sequence length further to 2×\\times×2 results in a performance degradation, likely because tokens at extremely low resolutions provide limited useful information and insufficient guidance for subsequent generation steps. Taking into account both generation quality and computational efficiency, we therefore adopt 8×\\times×8 as our default kickoff sequence length. patch size FID ↓↓\\downarrow↓ sFID ↓↓\\downarrow↓ IS ↑↑\\uparrow↑ Precision ↑↑\\uparrow↑ Recall ↑↑\\uparrow↑ speed† target res. 64×\\times×64; kickoff seq. len. 2×\\times×2; 600K iters 2×\\times×2 3.49 6.45 67.81 0.78 0.54 1.28 4×\\times×4 3.41 5.52 68.83 0.77 0.56 0.58 target res. 256×\\times×256; kickoff seq. len. 2×\\times×2; 100K iters 2×\\times×2 28.50 6.40 47.37 0.58 0.53 30.88 4×\\times×4 33.17 7.71 42.29 0.57 0.52 7.31 8×\\times×8 47.50 9.63 31.19 0.45 0.50 3.96 target res. 256×\\times×256; kickoff seq. len. 2×\\times×2; 1600K iters; EMA 4×\\times×4 2.81 5.48 251.79 0.82 0.55 7.31 8×\\times×8 4.65 5.42 195.50 0.79 0.54 3.96 Table 2: Effect of patch size.

    "content": "Next, we investigate the impact of patch size on model performance while maintaining a kickoff sequence length of 2×\\times×2. Initially, we experiment with a target resolution of 64×\\times×64 and compare two patch sizes—2×\\times×2 and 4×\\times×4—with results presented in the upper section of Table 2. We observe that PixelFlow achieves very similar performance across these two settings, with the 4×\\times×4 patch slightly outperforming the 2×\\times×2 patch on four out of five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, using a patch size of 4×\\times×4 eliminates the highest-resolution stage required by the 2×\\times×2 patch size configuration, thus improving efficiency. When scaling to a larger target resolution (i.e., 256×\\times×256), employing a patch size of 2×\\times×2 becomes computationally infeasible due to substantial resource demands, limiting our experiments to only 100K training iterations (middle section of Table 2). This constraint necessitates adopting larger patch sizes. Although increasing the patch size further to 8×\\times×8 significantly enhances computational efficiency, it leads to a noticeable drop in performance quality. Moreover, this performance gap persists even after extended training (1600K iterations), as shown in the bottom section of Table 2.

As the number of steps increases, we observe consistent improvements in FID, sFID, and IS, with the best overall performance achieved at 30 steps. Beyond this point, gains saturate and even slightly decline, indicating diminishing returns. A notable advantage of PixelFlow is its flexibility in assigning different numbers of sampling steps to each resolution stage during inference. This adaptive configuration allows fine-grained control over the sampling process, enabling performance–efficiency trade-offs. Moving beyond a uniform setting and exploring more granular stage-specific step allocations holds the potential for further performance enhancements."

As shown in Table 3(b), we compare the first-order Euler solver with the adaptive higher-order Dormand–Prince (Dopri5) solver [14]. The results indicate that Dopri5 consistently outperforms Euler across most evaluation metrics, achieving lower FID and sFID scores, a higher Inception Score, and slightly better precision, while maintaining similar recall. This demonstrates that more accurate and adaptive solvers, such as Dopri5, can better capture the generative dynamics, leading to higher-quality samples—though often with increased computational cost."

To comprehensively evaluate the performance of PixelFlow-T2I in text-to-image generation, we employ three widely recognized benchmarks, each targeting a different facet of compositional understanding: T2I-CompBench [27] assesses alignment between generated images and complex semantic relationships in text. We evaluate three tasks—color, shape, and texture binding—by generating five images per prompt across 300 prompts per sub-task. Alignment is measured using BLIP-VQA[36]; GenEval [19] evaluates compositional aspects such as coherence and spatial arrangement.

    "content": "We introduce PixelFlow, a novel image generation model that re-think the predominance of latent space based models by directly operating on raw pixel space. By directly transforming between different resolution stages, our model exhibits a compelling advantage in simplicity and end-to-end trainability. On both class-conditional image generation and text-to-image generation benchmarks, PixelFlow has been proven to demonstrate competitive image generation capabilities compared to popular latent space-based methods. We hope that this new perspective will inspire future research in visual generation models."

  {
    "title": "Limitations",
    "level": 4,
    "content": "Despite its advantages, PixelFlow still faces certain limitations. Although the model avoids full-resolution computation across all stages, the final stage requires full-resolution attention, which accounts for roughly 80% of the total inference time. Moreover, we observe that training convergence slows as the sequence length increases. Addressing these challenges presents opportunities for future improvements in efficiency and scalability."
