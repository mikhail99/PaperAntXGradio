Abstract.
Single-photon detector (SPD), an essential building block of the quantum
communication system, plays a fundamental role in developing next-generation
quantum technologies.
In this work, we propose an efficient modeling workflow
of nanowire SPDs utilizing avalanche breakdown at reverse-biased conditions.
The
proposed workflow is explored to maximize computational efficiency and balance time-
consuming drift-diffusion simulation with fast script-based post-processing. Without
excessive computational effort, we could predict a suite of key device performance
metrics, including breakdown voltage, dark/light avalanche built-up time, photon
detection efficiency, dark count rate, and the deterministic part of timing jitter due to
device structures. Implementing the proposed workflow onto a single InP nanowire and
comparing it to the extensively studied planar devices and superconducting nanowire
SPDs, we showed the great potential of nanowire avalanche SPD to outperform their
planar counterparts and obtain as superior performance as superconducting nanowires,
i.e., achieve a high photon detection efficiency of 70% with a dark count rate less than
20 Hz at non-cryogenic temperature. The proposed workflow is not limited to single-
nanowire or nanowire-based device modeling and can be readily extended to more
complicated two-/three dimensional structures.

1. Introduction
Single-photon detector (SPD), an essential building block for detecting and counting
photons, plays a fundamental role in many emerging and fast-evolving technologies, such
as quantum encryption and long-distance free-space quantum communication [1–4], light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) [5, 6], and single-photon time-of-flight 3D imaging [7–
10], to name a few. Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been devoted to

improving the performance of SPDs in terms of photon detection efficiency (PDE), dark
count rate (DCR), timing jitter, and most importantly, the capacity of fully integrated
generation, manipulation, and detection of single-photon quantum state all in one chip.
Most commercially available SPDs operate based on the photomultiplier or avalanche
mechanism to achieve single-photon level detection [11]. Photon detection technologies
based on the photomultiplier tube (PMT) have long been developed and matured for
almost a century.
Although PMT offers a very large active area which is desirable
for simplifying optical alignment in long-range free-space quantum communications, it
requires kilovolt-level operating conditions and suffers from high dark count rate and low
detection efficiency. SPDs based on avalanche mechanism have surpassed PMTs thanks
to their lower operating voltage, higher photon detection efficiency, ease of integration
into an array and compatibility with other parts of peripheral CMOS logic circuits.
Indeed, Si and InGaAs/InP based single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) have
dominated the market in the visible and near-infrared wavelength, respectively, with
other semiconductor materials such as germanium-on-silicon, HgCdTe, InGaAs/InAlAs,
and InSb sharing the rest [11, 12].
One
of
the
main
obstacles
to
advancing
single-photon
detection/counting
technologies is that different performance metrics usually have conflicting trends (e.g.
higher photon detection efficiency generally leads to larger dark count rate).
Thus
a trade-off in the design must be accounted for, depending on a specific application.
This drives extensive research to explore new device structures made available by
emerging low-dimensional nanostructures such as 1D nanowires (NWs) [13–16] and 0D
quantum dots [17–19]. For example, it has been demonstrated that superconducting
nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) promise the potential to closely approach
an ideal SPD performance by simultaneously achieving low dark count rate (1 Hz), high
detection efficiency (90% at wavelengths between 1520-1610 nm) and low timing jitter
(150 ps) [20]. However, a critical bottleneck of SNSPD devices is its requirement of
cryogenic temperature (<4 K), which drastically adds to the cost and complexity of
the experimental setup and becomes prohibitive to use for applications such as satellite
optical receivers [12].
On the other hand, exploring 1D semiconductor nanowire-based single-photon
avalanche detectors (NW-SPADs) has drawn increasing attention recently. It promises
to deliver as good performance as SNSPDs, i.e. high photon detection efficiency and
low timing jitter, but operating near room temperature [21]. Furthermore, the unique
advantage of NW-SPAD is that low dark count rate performance can be maintained
despite operating near room temperature, thanks to its nanoscale size and high material
quality [22]. Over the past decade, although many linear-mode NW-APDs have been
reported [23–32], there is only one report on nanowire APDs operating above their
breakdown voltage (i.e., NW-SPADs or Geiger-mode NW-APDs) [21], because of the
stringent requirement in epitaxial growth and device fabrication of these types of
nanowire devices.
It requires prudent device structural design and numerous cycles
of complicated and (perhaps) non-reproducible device fabrication, which is costly and

time-consuming. Hence, there is a great demand for developing a comprehensive device
modeling scheme to achieve a deep understanding of the critical design parameters and
provide timely guidance to material growth and device fabrication.
Over the past two decades, many numerical studies have been dedicated to modeling
SPAD performance [33–38]. The seminal work by Spinelli and Lacaita [33] pursued
both deterministic (i.e.
drift-diffusion model [39]) and stochastic (simplified Monte-
Carlo method [40]) modeling techniques to simulate transient terminal avalanche current
behavior and timing resolution. However, as pointed out by the authors, fully time-
dependent deterministic modeling required a formidable computational load with serious
numerical problems [41].
Thus the majority of the work relied on simplified and
equivalent lumped models. Other reported work either focused on one or two aspects of
SPAD performance or adopted a simplified model to mitigate the heavy computational
load of simulating avalanche phenomena. For example, Donnelly et al. and Jiang et
al. studied extensively the trade-offs between dark count rate and photon detection
efficiency [34, 35]; however, a complete drift-diffusion modeling was not considered.
Overall, there is still a lack of robust and efficient computational workflow to simulate
a suite of key SPAD performance metrics in the field.
In this work, we propose a hybrid numerical workflow that integrates time-
dependent drift-diffusion (DD) modeling, steady-state DD modeling, as well as a range of
auxiliary post-processing routines to predict the five most important SPAD performance
metrics, i.e., avalanche breakdown voltage, avalanche built-up time (corresponding to
SPAD sensing time), timing jitter, dark count rate, and photon detection efficiency.
Although the proposed workflow was demonstrated with single-nanowire SPAD in a
one-dimensional domain, it is general to more complicated structures in two/three
dimensions and not limited to nanowire-based devices.
It can also be extended to
include more SPAD metrics, such as afterpulsing probability, in future work.
2. Numerical methods
2.1. Proposed workflow
To maximize the usage of time-consuming drift-diffusion simulation and produce as
many device performance metrics as possible, we proposed the workflow shown in
figure 1 to predict the five most important SPAD metrics operating in the Geiger
mode: avalanche breakdown voltage, avalanche built-up time, timing jitter, dark count
rate (DCR) and photon detection efficiency (PDE). The COMSOL Multiphysics was
employed for the drift-diffusion (DD) simulations in this work. The workflow consists of
two parts: a relatively slow but comprehensive time-dependent DD solver that produces
three out of five SPAD metrics and other intermediate results for the subsequent process;
and a fast post-processing routine that takes some of the output from DD simulation
as input to compute the rest of performance metrics.
More specifically, the time-dependent DD solver is set up to compute time-

time-dependent IV curves) and timing jitter (from light time-dependent IV curves),

dependent current-voltage (IV) characteristics under dark and light conditions with
various external biases. Based on the IV curves, information on breakdown voltage can
be immediately extracted.
For applied bias beyond avalanche breakdown, terminal
current increases rapidly and reaches a plateau after an extended period (e.g., see
figure 2(b)). By fitting a standard logistic function to the current-time curve in dark
condition, the avalanche built-up time can be estimated, which corresponds to the lower
limit of SPADs’ sensing time (its inverse gives the maximum count rate). Likewise, the
light avalanche built-up time can be calculated under an optical excitation. However,
such response time varies depending on which part of the NW is under light excitation,
and the corresponding standard deviation estimates the (lower limit of) timing jitter.
Deploying a time-dependent DD solver provides important metrics of interest and
ensures better numerical stability and convergence than the commonly used steady-
state DD solver. This is because the regime after avalanche breakdown involves high
non-linearity and exponential increase of carriers in a very short period, which is by no
means a steady-state condition. Moreover, the space-charge effect that limits avalanche
current from approaching infinity cannot be correctly simulated with a steady-state
DD scheme, which is precisely the reason that steady-state DD simulations always
tend to diverge just a few volts beyond breakdown [42]. The examples of the electric

field with space-charge effect correctly recovered after avalanche breakdown can be
found in figure S1 in the supplementary material. Therefore, one must apply a time-
dependent DD solver (within the framework of deterministic modeling of SPADs) to
accurately predict SPAD device behavior, even though the apparent downside is that
time-dependent DD simulations are very time-consuming, which accounts for over 90%
of the total computation time. The time-dependent IV characteristics can also be fed
into the circuit-level lumped-sum modeling to optimise the peripheral electronics design,
such as the gating dynamics, if required. However, this is beyond the scope of this work.
On the other hand, although the steady-state DD scheme cannot accurately
simulate avalanche phenomena, it can still compute quantum efficiency (QE), which
characterizes how good incident photons are absorbed in NWs, regardless of whether
there is an avalanche. This is a much faster routine and has been used for NW solar
cell simulations with negligible computing time because it only requires a short-circuit
condition (i.e. zero bias) [43–45]. The generated QE is an input for computing photon
detection efficiency, as discussed in the following section.
A fast post-processing routine is set up outside the drift-diffusion simulation
workflow, taking the intermediate results from the drift-diffusion simulations as input
and directly computing the dark count rate and photon detection efficiency. The spatial
distribution of the electric field given by the time-dependent DD simulation is used to
calculate the avalanche triggering probability (ATP), the chance that an electron-hole
pair can trigger an avalanche event, following the scheme proposed by McIntyre [46]. For
SPADs, it is more meaningful to cite photon detection efficiency [47–50], defined as the
product of quantum efficiency and avalanche triggering probability. This is calculated
by the post-processing routine.
The dark count rate is another critical performance metric that characterizes the
SPAD miscounts in the absence of a target optical signal. It indicates the occurrence of
avalanche events triggered by thermally generated carriers or through other mechanisms
such as direct or trap-assisted tunneling in the multiplication region, also known as
dark carrier generation. These carrier generation terms are strong functions of the local
electric field and depend on material properties, especially the material defect density
and energy levels. The fast routine can easily compute these carrier generation rates
by combining the electric field (extracted from DD simulations) and information on
defects. The dark count rate is simply a product of dark carrier generation and avalanche
triggering probability, given that every dark-generated carrier only has a certain chance
to trigger an avalanche event.
Overall, the proposed workflow seeks to maximize the usage of time-consuming DD
simulation; both direct and indirect solutions from time-dependent DD simulations are
used to calculate key SPAD performance metrics.

2.2. Modeling SPAD performance
The time-dependent drift-diffusion model, which solves for IV curves and obtains spatial
electric field, consists of three coupled differential equations: the continuity equations for
electrons and holes, and the Poisson equation for electric potential [39]. To demonstrate
the proposed workflow and highlight the potential of nanowire-based SPADs, all
simulations in this work were performed at a temperature of 150 K, higher than the
cryogenic threshold temperature (120 K) [51]. The details of temperature dependent
material properties can be found in the supplementary material. Moreover, since the
working regime of Geiger-mode SPADs involves a large electric field after avalanche
breakdown, the high-field saturation of carrier drift velocity must be considered. We
adopt the commonly used Caughey-Thomas field-dependent model for carrier mobility
[52], also detailed in the supplementary material.
To accelerate the time-dependent DD simulation, we include only the most essential
physics relevant to avalanche SPAD devices: for carrier recombination, the standard
Shockley-Read-Hall model is applied [39]; for carrier generation, impact ionization and
optical generation are considered.
In particular, we adopt the ionization coefficient
model proposed in Ref. [53] based on Monte Carlo simulations, verified by experimental
data for temperatures ranging from 150 to 290 K. For the light generation model, for
simplicity, we assumed a laser source with single-photon level power that gives a spatially
uniform carrier generation rate inside the NW, as the light signal used in this work
is mainly for computing timing jitter. Optical simulation (e.g., finite-difference time-
domain (FDTD) simulation) can also be performed to obtain a more realistic carrier
generation profile, though not critical for this study [43, 54].
The terminal currents versus transient time under different external biases are
a direct product of time-dependent DD simulation (e.g., figure 2(b)), from which
breakdown voltage can be immediately determined. The dark avalanche built-up time
is estimated by fitting a logistic function to the terminal current.
Similarly, when
optical generation is added, light current versus time can be obtained. The avalanche
built-up time under light varies along the NW as it depends on which part of NW is
excited (assuming a laser excitation with finite spot size). We can simulate a series
of time-current curves by scanning a finite spot-size light source along the NW, and
thus obtaining a range of avalanche built-up time. The built-up time here includes the
time it takes to reach a threshold impact-ionization electric field, the time for carriers
generated in a low-field region drifting to the high-field multiplication region, and the
time for carriers generated in quasi-neutral region diffusing towards the multiplication
region. In reality, all three above processes involve statistical fluctuation, incurring an
extra and random delay. However, this work aims at fast deterministic modeling of
SPADs, so these stochastic processes are not included. Therefore, the resultant built-up
time is a lower limit of a SPAD’s timing response, i.e., theoretically, the best sensing
time. Furthermore, the standard deviation of light avalanche built-up time estimates
the SPAD timing jitter (also being a lower limit). Lateral diffusion of carriers in the

direction perpendicular to the external bias is not considered, which needs an extension
to the 2D/3D simulation domain. Such lateral diffusion within the depletion region is
expected to be minimal since the high electric field leads to drift-dominant transport.
The diffusion in the quasi-neutral region depends on the nanowire radius and will be
investigated in future work, especially when surface recombination is also introduced.
Dark count rate (DCR) and photon detection efficiency (PDE) are calculated via
post-processing routines, both of which rely on the electric field extracted from time-
dependent DD simulations. The electric field as a function of external biases is used to
compute impact ionization coefficients αe and αh for electrons and holes, respectively,
defined in Ref. [53], which strongly depend on the spatial distribution of the local electric
field.
These coefficients play a crucial role in determining the avalanche triggering
probability (ATP), which characterizes the probability of generated electron-hole pair
successfully triggering a self-sustaining avalanche, and is thus needed for calculating
DCR and PDE. We denote this probability as Ppair:
Ppair(x) = Pe(x) + Ph(x) −Pe(x)Ph(x),
(1)
where Pe and Ph are the probabilities that an electron or a hole can trigger an avalanche
event, respectively; the subtraction of PePh in the equation is to avoid counting twice
the avalanche triggered by both an electron and a hole [12]. It has long been proposed
that Pe and Ph can be modeled through the following differential equations for a p-i-n
structure, where the p-type region starts from x = 0 and ends with the n-type region
at x = L with L being the length of an NW [55]:
∂Pe
∂x = −(1 −Pe)αe(Pe + Ph −PePh),
∂Ph
∂x = (1 −Ph)αh(Pe + Ph −PePh).
(2)
Following the scheme proposed in Ref. [46], solutions of coupled equations above can be
found by solving a transcendental equation for Pe(x = 0):
1 = [1 −Pe(0)] exp

Once Pe(0) is solved, the ATP for electron-hole pairs, electrons and holes, respectively,

With the solved avalanche triggering probability Ppair, the DCR can be determined by:
DCR = A
Z L
0
Ppair(x)Gtot(x)dx,
(6)
where A is the cross-sectional area of the NW, and Gtot is the total dark carrier
generation rate. In this work, we include contributions from thermal generation based
on the Shockley-Read-Hall model (GSRH), direct band-to-band tunneling (GBBT), and
trap-assisted tunneling (GTAT) [34–36]; the corresponding formulations can be found in
the supplementary material.
As mentioned before,
extra information on quantum efficiency (QE) that
characterizes photon absorption and carrier collection is needed to compute photon
detection efficiency. The spatial QE profile can be calculated as:
QE(x) = Iph(x)/q
GoptVopt
,
(7)
where Iph is the photo-current measured from the device terminal, whose magnitude
depends on which part of the NW is optically excited (thus a function of x). Gopt is the
carrier generation rate due to the optical signal, and Vopt is the volume where Gopt is
applied, which can be approximated as Vopt ≈Ad, where d is the optical excitation size
(i.e. averaged beam size); here d can be set to a realistic value based on the laser spot
size, or it can be smaller if a detailed mapping of QE is desired to fully characterize
its optical response. The light carrier generation Gopt is related to material absorption,
reflection, incident laser power, and device geometries. For array-based nanowire devices
with sub-wavelength feature sizes, the resonant light trapping renders the conventional
ray optics description inaccurate. In that case, Gopt has no simple analytical formulation,
such as the Beer-Lambertian type of absorption commonly adopted in the previous
works [47–50]. As a result, a more complicated light absorption profile Gopt can only be
obtained by numerical simulations [56–58]. Nevertheless, performing extra numerical
simulations to obtain a more realistic Gopt for a single-nanowire device is not essential
for this study. Thus, we assumed a spatially uniform generation rate and adopted the
following simple formulation:
Gopt(λ) = α(λ) [1 −R(λ)] PLaser
d2
λ
hc,
(8)
where PLaser is the laser power, α(λ) is the absorption coefficient, R(λ) is the fraction

3. Results and discussion
To investigate the performance of single-NW based SPAD, a p-i-n homojunction indium
phosphide (InP) NW lying horizontally on a substrate is simulated. An Ohmic contact
is assumed at the ends of both p- and n-segments. The NW has a diameter of 200
nm and a length of 3 µm, with the p-segment length fixed at 1 µm and the i-segment
varied from 250 to 1850 nm, whilst the n-segment length is varied accordingly to give a
fixed total NW length. A simplified device schematic is shown in figure 2(a). Assuming
that NW is grown from an n-type InP substrate, a highly doped n-type InP segment
can be grown first, followed by an unintentionally doped i-region and p-doped top
segment.
In practice, it is still challenging to have a heavily doped p-type NW by
selective-area metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (SA-MOVPE) [22]. Hence, based on
the experimental information, we fixed the n-segment doping at 1×1018 cm−3 and varied
the p-type doping from 1 × 1017 cm−3 (experimentally achievable [22, 59]) to 1 × 1018
cm−3. The i-region is slightly n-doped due to the background doping often observed in
undoped InP NWs by SA-MOVPE growth [22]. The i-region doping is also varied from
5 × 1015 to 1 × 1017 cm−3 to explore its impact on SPAD performance.

Solving the time-dependent DD model gives the time-dependent terminal current
at different biases as direct output. An example is shown in figure 2(b) for an i-region
thickness of 950 nm with p-/n- and i-region doping of 1 × 1018 and 5 × 1015 cm−3,
respectively. The temporal behavior of terminal current below and beyond avalanche
breakdown can be easily seen. Below the breakdown, the current experience some initial
fluctuation and gradually reaches a steady state with a negligibly small current. On the
other hand, as applied bias becomes equal to or greater than the breakdown voltage,
the current rapidly ramps up and soon saturates at a certain level. The black circle
highlights the avalanche built-up time, which is the period elapsed from the external
bias is applied until a stable avalanche current is obtained. To estimate such built-up
time, the time-current curve is first normalized by its maximum current and fitted by
a logistic function. Truncating the fitting curve where its gradient is smaller than a
prescribed threshold determines the build-up time. We take 10−6 ps−1 as the truncation
threshold, considered small enough to be a reasonable criterion for a steady state. The
fact that time-dependent current reaches a plateau when avalanche breakdown occurs
indicates that the space-charge effect is correctly recovered in the simulations. Hence
the current does not tend to go to infinity (see more discussion in the supplementary
material).
Once the breakdown current reaches a steady state, the terminal current at the
last simulation timestep is extracted as the final terminal current, usually a few
hundred picoseconds longer than the avalanche built-up time, highlighted in red stars
in figure 2(b).
No further simulation beyond this point is needed since the current
fluctuation is too small to detect experimentally.
Figure 2(c) shows the current-
voltage characteristics for a range of i-region thicknesses Li with the same doping as in
figure 2(b). It can be clearly seen that the breakdown voltage reduces with the decrease
of i-region thickness.

doping cases.

Figure 3 summarizes the extracted breakdown voltage as a function of i-region
thickness for all doping cases, showing that a thinner i-region gives a smaller breakdown
voltage. Avalanche breakdown is triggered once the electric field within the i-region
reaches a threshold. For a thinner i-region, a smaller bias is enough to reach the threshold
electric field.
Although the breakdown voltage for a particular i-region thickness is
similar between nanowires and the planar counterparts (e.g., see Ref. [60]), it does not
necessarily cause other issues, such as comparably high dark count rates, thanks to the
nanowire’s miniaturized volume, which will be discussed later. For the same p-segment
doping (grouped by red or blue grading colors) and i-region thickness, an increase in
i-region doping also gives a smaller breakdown voltage, consistent with widely cited
theoretical analysis [39]. Overall, higher p-segment doping reduces breakdown voltage
for all i-region thickness/doping cases.
Moreover, as i-region doping increases and
becomes comparable to p-region doping (e.g., Ni ≥5 × 1016 cm−3), the breakdown
voltage is less dependent on i-region thickness since the effective multiplication region
is primarily located at the p-i junction and does not span the entire i-region. Hence,
varying i-region thickness has a limited impact on the breakdown voltage.
The avalanche built-up time extracted from the dark time-dependent current curve
is plotted against reverse bias beyond breakdown, as shown in figure 4 for all doping
cases.
This ‘dark’ avalanche built-up time can be regarded as the lower bound of
the SPAD sensing response, as it characterizes the time taken to trigger an avalanche
breakdown without photon excitation. Under the light condition, the response time
will usually be shorter (with a few exceptions, as discussed later). However, there is
no longer a single-valued built-up time to cite in the light case, as it depends on which
part of the NW is optically excited. The inverse of avalanche built-up time can also
be seen as the intrinsic maximum count rate of photons, being ‘intrinsic’ because it is
independent of the effects from quenching, hold-off and reset times that usually depend
on peripheral quenching circuits and specific applications (but not device itself).
We performed simulations up to 3 V above avalanche breakdown voltage for all
testing cases. Figure 4 shows that avalanche built-up time drops quickly by one order
of magnitude when reverse bias increases by only several volts. Regardless of the i-
region thickness, for both high and low p-segment doping cases, the dark built-up time
can drop below 1 ns when the reverse bias is 1.0 V beyond breakdown. For p- and
i-region doping of 1018 and 1016 cm−3, respectively, the built-up time fluctuates for
Li = 1050 and 1450 nm. This is because some of the current experience a sudden surge,
quickly reaching a comparable current level to other Li cases. However, the current is
yet to stabilize, resulting in a longer total built-up time. Overall, a larger reverse bias
is preferred to achieve a sub-nanosecond SPAD sensing time and a better maximum
count rate. However, a larger bias with high electric field in the i-region also leads to a
higher dark count rate. Such a trade-off must be considered, depending on whether the
maximum count rate or DCR poses a more stringent limit on specific applications.
When the device is exposed to optical excitation, the light time-dependent terminal
currents can similarly be simulated to extract the light avalanche built-up time. The

single-photon source used in this work has an input power of 5.68 pW at a wavelength
of 700 nm, which gives a single photon per pulse, assuming a laser repetition rate of
20 MHz commonly used in experiments [61]. The top right schematic in figure 5 shows
the setup of simulations in the light condition: a laser spot size of 300 nm in diameter
is assumed, within which the carrier generation is enabled. Here the laser spot size
is much smaller than a realistic laser spot size because we want to obtain a detailed
mapping that characterizes the NW intrinsic photo-response, which in fact, should be
independent of optical excitation spot size. Initially, the excitation ‘box’ is placed at
the p-doped end of NW, and is progressively scanned through the entire NW with a
step size of 300 nm. In total, it generates ten light simulation data, each giving a light
avalanche built-up time. The light avalanche built-up time varies due to an interplay
of several competing processes (i.e., light-generated carrier diffusion, low-field drift and
recombination). The variation of spatially dependent light avalanche built-up time thus
induces a timing jitter. It should be noted that such timing jitter is a lower limit of
the actual one since various statistical fluctuations of avalanche are not considered; in
other words, it is the ‘deterministic’ part of the actual timing jitter, which can be well
predicted in this proposed workflow once the device structure is given.
Figure 5(a) shows two examples of time-dependent terminal currents under light
condition for i-region thickness of 1850 and 250 nm, respectively, both with p-/i- doping
of 1018 and 5 × 1015 cm−3 at an excess bias of Ve =1.5 V. The excess bias is defined
as Ve = Va −VB, where Va and VB are applied reverse bias and breakdown voltage,
respectively. For reference, the dark time-dependent current is also plotted in black; the

time in dark condition (lines plus symbols) and under light (lines only) as a function
of excess bias, extracted from figure 5(a). Notice that excess bias is calculated based
on dark breakdown voltage. For the i-region of 1850 nm under illumination, an earlier
breakdown is found at 0.5 V below dark breakdown voltage, thus giving Ve = −0.5
V. To fully reveal the spatial variation of light avalanche built-up time, the data in
figure 5(b) can be reorganized to present as a function of laser excitation location, as
shown in figure 5(c). Correspondingly the induced timing jitter can then be obtained
by calculating the standard deviation of each curve.
From figure 5(c), a noticeable trend is that light avalanche built-up time is larger
outside the i-region, which can be easily understood since light-generated carriers need
to first diffuse to the multiplication region (i-region) before triggering an avalanche. A
more interesting observation is that light avalanche built-up time is not always shorter
than its dark counterpart, especially when the i-region is thin. Here we highlight a case
shown in the lower panel of figure 5(c) for i-region thickness of 250 nm (i.e., the i-region
is located at 1000 to 1250 nm along the NW axis), where the red line indicates the dark
avalanche built-up time at Ve = 1.5 V. It can be seen that for laser excitation beyond
2000 nm, the light avalanche built-up time is longer than the dark one. This is because
the minority carriers (i.e. holes) generated at the far end of NW (an n-type region)
recombine on their way diffusing to the i-region, given that the maximum hole diffusion
length is only about 350 nm (as calculated based on Einstein’s relation with carrier
mobility, see details in the supplementary material). The excess holes localised in the
n-region can also diffuse towards the contact, contributing to dark current and lowering
the light current such that it takes longer for the device to reach avalanche. On the
other hand, such observation is not seen for the minority carrier (electron) generated at
the p-doped end of NW because of its longer diffusion length (∼1 µm). Overall, the
essence is that an excitation spot far away from the multiplication region can directly
impair the device response speed.
The standard deviation of light avalanche built-up time along the NW, as shown
in figure 5(c), estimates the lower limit of SPAD timing jitter. Given the similar trend
observed for different i-region thickness and doping, we summarize the timing jitter
performance for a few representative cases in figure 6. Timing jitter, similar to avalanche
built-up time, decreases as excess bias increases. For low i-doping of 5 × 1015 cm−3, a
thinner i-region tends to give a larger timing jitter for most bias points. However, as
i-doping increases to 1 × 1017 cm−3, the difference becomes negligible. Regardless of
i-region thickness and doping, for excess bias of more than 2 V, the timing jitter can be
less than 50 ps. For high i-region doping at Ve = 3 V, the timing jitter can be smaller
than 10 ps, revealing that single-NW-based SPADs have great potential for high-speed
and low-latency applications.
The breakdown voltage, avalanche built-up time and timing jitter discussed above
are all extracted directly from the time-dependent DD simulations. For the rest of the
SPAD performance metrics, we then used post-processing routines to calculate PDE and
DCR. The calculation of detection efficiency also needs a separate quantum efficiency

Timing jitter performance for a selection of p-/i- doping and i-region
thicknesses. For each p-doping case, we choose the lowest and highest i-doping cases,

nm).
simulation from the fast steady-state DD solver. The spatial PDE(x) as a function of the
NW axis can be calculated as per equation 9. Figure 7 shows two examples of PDE(x)
for high and low p-doping cases with the same i-region doping of Ni = 5 × 1015 cm−3
at a range of excess biases. It is easily seen that PDE(x) increases with a larger excess
voltage. More specifically, for the high p-doping case (upper panel), a thicker i-region
leads to overall better PDE(x) along the NW. In contrast, for the low p-doping case, a
thinner i-region is preferred. Moreover, for high p-doping, a peak PDE(x) above 60%
is achieved at Li = 1850 nm with higher Ve. For the low p-doping case, excess voltage
exhibits a less significant effect on PDE(x); for all i-region thicknesses Li, there is only
a slightly increased PDE with increased Ve. The highest peak PDE(x) of Li = 250 nm
remains above 40% for all Ve.
The spatial photon detection efficiency can also be length-averaged within a width
of half maximum by equation 10, which gives a single-valued mean detection efficiency
⟨PDE⟩. Figure 8 shows that mean detection efficiency ⟨PDE⟩increases with a larger
excess bias Ve. Also, as i-region doping increases, the difference in ⟨PDE⟩given by
different Li becomes smaller. This is because a larger i-region doping shifts the high-field
space-charge region closer to the p-i junction, and for cases such as Ni = 1 × 1017 cm−3,
the carrier multiplication region is primarily at the p-i junction, shorter than the i-region
thickness. Hence, varying Li has a limited effect on changing the peak field strength, and
PDE only increases slightly. Furthermore, suppose p-region doping is also low (such that
p-/i-region doping contrast is small). In that case, the high-field multiplication region is
essentially always near the p-i junction, regardless of the actual i-region thickness. As a
result, a thick i-region is not desirable as it creates an inefficient, low-field quasi-neutral
region away from the p-i junction, which is not beneficial for carrier collection and also
has a low avalanche triggering probability. This is why for all the low p-doping cases
(i.e., the lower panel of figure 8), a thin i-region thickness is preferred. On the other
hand, when the doping contrast between the i- and p-region is large, such as in the case
of Ni = 5 × 1015 cm−3 with Np = 1 × 1018 cm−3, the high-field multiplication region

a lower bound of NW-SPAD’s peak PDE performance. Nevertheless, NW-SPADs can
achieve high mean detection efficiency ranging from 20% to nearly 60% for cases of high
p-/i-region doping contrast where a thick i-region is preferred (e.g., Ni = 5 × 1015 cm−3
with Np = 1018 cm−3). When the p-/i-region doping contrast is low and a thin i-region is
ideal, an even higher efficiency approaching 70% can be obtained (e.g., Ni = Np = 1017
cm−3). To compare, the customized cutting-edge planar InGaAs/InP SPDs typically
present detection efficiencies of 25%∼33%, though at higher operation temperatures of
163∼240 K [11, 12]. For array-based NW-SPADs, the light-trapping effect allows for
highly concentrated light absorption to be focused precisely around the multiplication
region by manipulating array pitch size and NW radius [62].
In this scenario, it
is possible for array-based NW-SPADs to achieve the maximum detection efficiency
observed in the spatial PDE(x) profile, where a detection efficiency approaching 90%
can be obtained (see figure 10).
Figure 9. The Dark count rate is calculated for a defect density of NT = 1012 cm−3
for all doping cases.
To demonstrate the dependence of DCR on i-region thickness and doping, we
performed the calculations through the post-processing routines for defect densities of
NT =[1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014] cm−3.
Under the same conditions (i.e., the same
Li, Ni, Np and Ve), DCR is proportional to the defect density.
Figure 9 shows an
example of computed DCR for all doping cases with a defect density of 1012 cm−3.
The computed DCR for the full range of defect densities can be found in figure S2
(supplementary material). Based on equations S5 and S6 in the supplementary material,
DCR increases with excess bias due to enhanced direct band-to-band and trap-assisted
tunneling under a high electric field. However, the rate of increase for higher Ve slows
down and eventually becomes much less noticeable as i-region doping increases. This
is most evident for the low p-doping case, where the DCR is nearly independent of

excess bias. When the doping contrast between the i- and p-doped regions is low, the
high-field multiplication region is primarily located at the p-i junction. The over-bias
beyond avalanche breakdown does not significantly increase the peak electric field at
the junction but merely expands the space-charge region into the neutral region, where
the dark carrier generation remains relatively low. This is why the increase of DCR at a
larger excess voltage is limited for the cases of low p-doping and high i-doping. On the
other hand, in the case of high doping contrast, the high-field space-charge region spans
the entire i-doped region. Increasing excess voltage further enhances the peak electric
field, where the dark carrier generation is the largest. Hence there is still an apparent
increase in DCR as the excess bias increases. For the same reason, it is noted that as
i-region doping Ni becomes larger, the DCR dependence on the i-region thickness also
becomes much smaller since the high-field multiplication region is always around the p-i
junction, regardless of actual i-region thickness.
Overall, by adjusting the i-region doping/thickness and p-region doping, the dark
count rate of a single-nanowire SPAD may vary over several orders of magnitude. In
particular, for low i-region doping of 5 × 1015 or 1 × 1016 cm−3, a dark count rate
less than 1 Hz can be achieved, giving as superior performance as the cutting-edge
superconducting nanowire-based SPD [20]; such performance, if achieved in the future,
is projected to outperform the customized planar InP SPADs, which typically give dark
counts ranging from 10 (operated at 163 K) to 26 kHz (at 240 K) [11, 12].
Lastly,
comparing the trend of dark count rate in figure 9 to that of photon detection efficiency
in figure 8, an apparent trade-off between these two metrics can be noted: wherever the
detection efficiency is high, a high dark count rate ensues.
To investigate such a trade-off and to highlight the potential of nanowire-based
SPADs, figure 10 shows dark count rates plotted against the maximum photon detection
efficiencies (extracted from spatial PDE(x) profiles) for all doping cases. We assumed
a high-quality NW grown by SA-MOVPE (i.e.
a defect density of 1010 cm−3) that
has been demonstrated experimentally [22, 59, 63].
Despite a general trend that a
higher DCR accompanies a larger PDE, the degree of such trade-off can be potentially
mitigated by properly adjusting the i-region thickness and doping. To guide the material
growth and device fabrication for a particular application, for example, aiming at PDE
around 70% (at 700 nm) and DCR between 10 to 100 Hz, one can simply pick an
appropriate candidate from eight configurations (of different i-region thickness and i-/p-
region doping), shown as eight sub-figures in figure 10. It is noted that a structure of
Li = 250 nm with the i-/p-region doping of Ni = 5×1016 cm−3 and Np = 1×1017 cm−3,
respectively, can achieve the design objective. To put this in context, if such a design
is realized experimentally, it will closely follow some of the champion and commercial
single-photon detectors based on superconducting NWs, whose peak PDE is around
85% to 95% with a DCR between 102 to 104 Hz [15, 64], but at a much higher, non-
cryogenic temperature (150 K in this work) rather than ≤5 K for superconducting NW
based detectors. It should be noted that experimentally, it is still challenging to have as
delicate control of NW doping as in numerical simulations. Fortunately, based on the

simulations, having an i-region doping less or greater than 5 × 1016 cm−3 for Li = 250
nm will not substantially compromise the performance. For example, if the i-region ends
up being less n-doped, although the peak PDE declines to around 50%, DCR decreases
to less than 10 Hz. On the other hand, a more heavily doped i-region will have a PDE
> 80% at the expense of increased DCR to 103 Hz.
Figure 10. Dark count rate versus peak PDE is plotted assuming a high-quality NW
with defect density of NT = 1010 cm−3 for all doping cases.
Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the impact of nanowire surface defect states on
the NW-SPAD performance was not included due to the 1D device structure studied
in this work. The surface states acting as recombination centers in the quasi-neutral
regions can capture light-generated carriers as they diffuse towards the multiplication
region to trigger an avalanche event, decreasing the device’s carrier collection efficiency
and eventually leading to a lower photon detection efficiency.
Furthermore, carriers
captured by the surface defects during the avalanche may be detrapped and induce
new avalanche events, i.e., afterpulsing [21].
Nevertheless, InP nanowires grown by
metal-organic vapor-phase or vapor-liquid-solid epitaxy are generally reported with low
surface defect densities and surface recombination velocity [22, 59, 65, 66]. InP nanowire
solar cells have been reported with record efficiencies for both epitaxially grown and
top-down etched arrays without intentional surface passivation [62, 67], indicating that
surface defect issue may be limited in compromising photon detection efficiency. The
effect of surface defects on afterpulsing probability will be investigated in future work.
Overall, our simulations indicate that with proper design, it is promising to achieve high-
performance NW-based SPADs that can outperform current state-of-the-art detectors
based on other technologies.

4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated an efficient workflow to model a suite of key performance
metrics for single nanowire-based single-photon avalanche detectors, which, to our
knowledge, has yet to be reported. The workflow incorporates the relatively slow drift-
diffusion solver and several fast post-processing routines to maximize computational
efficiency. With this, the avalanche breakdown voltage, dark/light avalanche built-up
time, deterministic part of timing jitter, dark count rate, and photon detection efficiency
can be modeled in an integrated and computationally efficient way.
The proposed
workflow can effectively serve as a mapping tool between application-driven metrics
and a span of design parameters to accelerate the design-fabrication cycle for a high
throughput of high-performance devices. Furthermore, our showcase of implementing
the workflow onto a single InP nanowire SPAD operating at non-cryogenic temperature
reveals the great potential in mitigating the common trade-offs between high detection
efficiency/low timing jitter and high dark counts seen in the planar counterparts, thanks
to the extremely small active volume of nanowires (i.e., low DCR) and possible tuning
of various optical resonant modes for highly localized excitation (i.e., high PDE and
low timing jitter). With a proper structural design and material doping, the nanowire
SPAD is projected to simultaneously achieve a high detection efficiency of 70% with a
dark count rate less than 20 Hz operated at 150 K. It greatly enhances the freedom in
designing avalanche photodetectors and highlights that nanowires are among the most
promising candidates for high-performance single-photon detection.
