Loss Function for Electric Field Network:**\n\nThe loss function is designed to dynamically weight samples during training. It consists of the following components:\n\n*   **Weighted Samples:** Each sample in a batch is assigned a weight based on its contribution to the overall electric field distribution. This weighting is not explicitly described in the text, but the implication is that samples with higher impact on the overall field receive higher weights.\n*   **Sample Loss:**  A standard loss function (not specified, but likely Mean Squared Error or similar) is calculated for each sample.\n*   **Weighted Sample Loss:** The sample loss is multiplied by the corresponding sample weight.\n*   **Batch-wise Aggregation:** The weighted sample losses are averaged to obtain a composite loss (LEF).\n    *   `LEF = (1/m) * \u03a3 (wi * Li)` where `m` is the batch size, `wi` is the weight for sample `i`, and `Li` is the loss for sample `i`.\n\n**3. Inverse Design Workflow:**\n\n1.  **Client Input:** The workflow starts with a client-specified photon detection efficiency (PDEclientclient{}_{\\text{client}}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT client end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT).\n2.  **Random Forest Algorithm:** A random forest algorithm generates an input vector containing nanowire structural and material properties, along with the excess voltage (Vasubscript\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4eV_{a}italic_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT).\n3.  **Forward Networks:** The input vector is fed into the electric field and quantum efficiency networks to predict the electric field distribution and quantum efficiency, respectively.\n4.  **Performance Evaluation:** The predicted quantum efficiency is used to calculate a predicted photon detection efficiency (PDEpredictedpredicted{}_{\\text{predicted}}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT predicted end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT).\n5.  **Comparison and Adjustment:** The predicted PDE is compared to the client-specified PDE. If they differ by more than a user-defined margin (\u03f5italic-\u03f5\\epsilonitalic_\u03f5), the excess voltage is adjusted, and the process repeats.\n6.  **Dark Count Rate Calculation:** Once the predicted PDE meets the client's requirements, the corresponding dark count rate (DCR) is calculated based on the material defect density.\n\n**4. Key Parameters:**\n\n*   **Nanowire Structural Parameters:** Dimensions, shape, material composition.\n*   **Material Properties:** Doping concentrations, bandgap energy, dielectric constant.\n*   **Excess Voltage (Vasubscript\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4eV_{a}italic_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT):** The voltage applied beyond the avalanche breakdown voltage.\n*   **Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE):** The primary performance metric for the SPAD.\n*   **Dark Count Rate (DCR):** A secondary performance metric, representing the rate of false detections.\n*   **Margin (\u03f5italic-\u03f5\\epsilonitalic_\u03f5):** The acceptable difference between the predicted and client-specified PDE."
