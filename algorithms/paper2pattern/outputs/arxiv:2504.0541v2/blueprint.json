It's pre-computed based on the noisy inputs.\n*   **Cost Matrix (\ud835\udc02):** A matrix of size N x K, where N is the number of denoising steps and K is a parameter.  C[i, k] represents the minimum cost to reach step i using the first k steps.\n*   **Traced Path Matrix (\ud835\udc0f):** A matrix of size N x K. P[i, k] stores the index of the previous step that leads to the optimal cost to reach step i using the first k steps.\n*   **State Transition Function (Eq. 7):** This function calculates the cost of reaching step *i* using the first *k* steps, considering the cost of reaching the previous step *j* and the similarity cost between *j* and *i*.\n*   **Argmin Function (Eq. 8):** This function determines the previous step that leads to the minimum cost to reach step *i* using the first *k* steps.\n*   **Backtracking:** After constructing the cost and traced path matrices, backtracking is used to reconstruct the optimal sequence of denoising steps by following the traced path from the end to the beginning.\n\n**4. Main Steps for Implementation:**\n\n1.  **Compute Similarity Matrix (\ud835\udc12):** Calculate the cosine distance between all pairs of denoising steps and store the results in the similarity matrix \ud835\udc12.\n2.  **Initialize Cost and Traced Path Matrices:** Initialize the first column of the cost matrix \ud835\udc02 with the similarity costs from the starting step to all other steps. Initialize the traced path matrix \ud835\udc0f with the indices of the previous steps.\n3.  **Iterative Cost Calculation:** Iterate through the remaining columns of the cost and traced path matrices. For each step *i* and column *k*, calculate the cost of reaching *i* using the first *k* steps using the state transition function (Eq. 7). Update the cost matrix \ud835\udc02 and traced path matrix \ud835\udc0f accordingly.\n4.  **Backtracking:** After completing the iterative cost calculation, perform backtracking on the traced path matrix \ud835\udc0f, starting from the last column, to reconstruct the optimal sequence of denoising steps.\n5.  **Self-Condition Sharing:** Use the optimal sequence of denoising steps (\u03a6) to guide the sharing of self-condition between adjacent denoising steps.\n\n**5. Considerations:**\n\n*   **Computational Complexity:** The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of denoising steps.\n*   **Memory Usage:** The cost and traced path matrices require O(N^2) memory.\n*   **Optimization:** The implementation can be optimized by using efficient matrix operations and parallelization."
